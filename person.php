                                <li>Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 1912 in Paddington, London.</li>
                                <li>For most of Alan's life him and his brother were fostered in many different homes throughout their lives.</li>
                                <li>As for his love life, he was very isolated but had no affection towards women.</li>
                                <li>Alan was always passionate about sciences and chemistry but always considered himself a failure due to how diverse the 19th century was.</li>

                                <li>In 1936, Alan turing was studying for his Ph.D in mathematics when he published
                                a paper on <q><i>Computable Numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungs problem.</i></q></li>
                                <li>In this paper he had announced his idea about a theoritcal machine that can perform algorithmic functions on paper tape. In his theory he had mentioned that this machine could
                                do square roots, sudoku puzzles, basically making it a universal computing machine.</li>
                                <li>His theory soon came to be the foundation of computer science. </li>
